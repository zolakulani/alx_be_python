1. Mastering Inheritance and Composition in Python
mandatory
Objective: Deepen your understanding of inheritance and composition in Python by creating a system that models a library with different types of books.

Task Description:
Develop two Python scripts: library_system.py and main.py. In library_system.py, youâ€™ll define a base class Book and two derived classes, EBook and PrintBook, showcasing inheritance. Additionally, implement a Library class demonstrating composition by managing a collection of books.

library_system.py:
Base Class - Book:

Attributes: title (str) and author (str).
Method: __init__(self, title, author) for initializing book attributes.
Derived Classes - EBook and PrintBook:

Both classes inherit from Book.
EBook additional attribute: file_size (int).
PrintBook additional attribute: page_count (int).
Each derived class should have its own __init__ method that properly calls the base class __init__ while also initializing its unique attribute.
Composition - Library:

Attributes: books (a list to store instances of Book, EBook, and PrintBook).
Methods:
add_book(self, book): Adds a Book, EBook, or PrintBook instance to the library.
list_books(self): Prints details of each book in the library.
